# Bagisto Bulk Upload

By using this add-on, the admin can mass/bulk upload products of all types: simple, configurable, virtual, grouped, bundle, downloadable, booking.

It packs in lots of demanding features that allows your business to scale in no time:

- Product can be upload by CSV / XLS files.
- Data profile creation feature for admin.
- Each attribute has a different column.
